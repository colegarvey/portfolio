    <p>Hi!  I am a current student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, enjoying my time here <br>
    as a computer science major.  I love the outdoors and being outside doing all sorts of activities <br> 
    like hiking and outdoor games in the summer and of course snowboarding the mountians during the winter <br>
    I am also very big into being fit and working out, it is a real passion of mine and I couldn't imagine <br>
    where I would be today without it.</p>
